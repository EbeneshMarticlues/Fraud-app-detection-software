# Fraud-app-detection-software
 code assumes that the dataset is stored in a CSV file named fraud_app_detection.csv. The code first loads the dataset, explores it by printing the head and summary statistics, and visualizes the target variable distribution using a count plot.

Next, the code prepares the dataset for training by separating the target variable (is_fraud) from the feature variables and standardizing the features. The code then splits the dataset into training and testing sets using a 80-20 split.

After that, the code trains a logistic regression model on the training set and makes predictions on the testing set. Finally, the code evaluates the model using the accuracy score and confusion matrix. The accuracy score is a measure of how well the model predicts the target variable, while the confusion matrix shows how many true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives the model predicted.
